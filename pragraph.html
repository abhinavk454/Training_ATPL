      A <b>computer</b> is device that accepts <b>information</b> (<i
        >in the form of digitalized data</i
      >) and manipulates it for some result based on a program or sequence of
      instructions on how data is to be processed. Complex computers also needs
      the means for storing data (including the program, which is also a form of
      data) for some necessary duration. A <b>program</b> may be invariable and
      built into the computer (<i
        >and called logic circuitry as it is on microprocessors</i
      >) or different program may be provided to the computer (loaded into its
      storage and then started by administrator or user).
      <u>Today's computer have both type of programming</u>.

      An <b>operating systems</b> (<i>OS</i>) is a software program that manages
      computer hardware and software resources and provides common service for
      computer programs. The operating system is a component of the
      <b>system software</b> in a computer system. One can write H2O like
      H<sub>2</sub>O also algebra expression is like
      a<sup>2</sup>+b<sup>2</sup>+2ab can be (a+b)<sup>2</sup>
      and so on.
