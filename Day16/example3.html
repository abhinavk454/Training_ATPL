          lion, (Panthera leo), large, powerfully built cat (family Felidae)
          that is second in size only to the tiger. The proverbial “king of
          beasts,” the lion has been one of the best-known wild animals since
          earliest times. Lions are most active at night and live in a variety
          of habitats but prefer grassland, savanna, dense scrub, and open
          woodland. Historically, they ranged across much of Europe, Asia, and
          Africa, but now they are found mainly in parts of Africa south of the
          Sahara. An isolated population of about 650 Asiatic lions constitute a
          slightly smaller race that lives under strict protection in India’s
          Gir National Park and Wildlife Sanctuary.
