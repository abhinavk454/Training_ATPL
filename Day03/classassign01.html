        Himachal Pradesh is as scenic as it gets. There is a reason why so many
        of our domestic vacations begin and end with Himachal Pradesh in mind!
        While everyone is aware about the beauty of Manali and the old-world
        charm of Shimla – we, at DoW pride ourselves in introducing you to the
        lesser known wonderlands hidden in plain sight. One such beauty lies in
        the unassuming village of Gushaini! Tirthan, Banjar and Sainj Valleys
        are some of the most unknown, unexplored regions that are well connected
        by a road network. The beginning of Great Himalayan National park sees
        these valleys dotted around. Over the course of the coming articles, I
        will introduce you to this charming region of the hills.

            The big entrance to the Great Himalayan National Park lies this
            quaint little town of Gushaini. Literally 10 KMs from the big
            mammoth National Park, Gushaini lies at an elevation of 4500 ft.
            With natural groves of the hills, the captivating aura of the
            Tirthan river is only catapulted further by the lush green Himalayas
            all around. If Parvati valley is stunning for its magnanamous and
            very alive Parvati River, then Tirthan Valley is calm, cool and
            collected like the river that flows through it too! So calm, so
            tranquil – you’ll soon be in a trance like no other. The river is
            also the home of the epic Himalayan Trouts, which is why this valley
            is often nicknamed as the Trout Country! Most people heading on
            treks in to the Great Himalayan National Park are well aware of
            Gushaini. The town itself offers a host of activities from fishing
            and angling to river crossing, rappelling, hiking, camping – you can
            do it all here. Or, if you prefer- you can choose to do aboslutely
            nothing, nada, zilch and still get the most of your adventure! Such
            is the charm of this tiny town.

              Akin to the region, the weather is pretty synonymous with most of
              the Himalayas. Summer months are pleasant, winter months are a
              magical wonderland and monsoon season is best avoided! If you’re
              looking for enjoying the lush green hills – head to Gushaini right
              after the monsoon season. Best months for sightseeing are April –
              September (minus the monsoon period, of course!)
