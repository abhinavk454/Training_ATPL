    <h2><u>Introduction to Algebra</u></h2>
    <p>
      <b>Mathematics</b> is vast field. It is impossible for one person to know
      everything there is to know in mathematics,
      <s>even after a lifetime of study.</s>
    </p>
    <p>
      As we approach the higher classes, we see our introduction to algebra. In
      algebra,
      <u
        >we substitutes numbers with letters or alphabets to arrive at a
        solution.</u
      >
      We use these letters like (<b><i>x,a,b</i></b> etc.) to represent unknown
      quantity in an equation.
      <hr/>
      Remember, only write learning is not enough. You must know how to effectively apply these formulas to a problem.

    <ul>
        <li>
            a<sup>2</sup>-b<sup>2</sup>= (a-b)(a+b)
        </li>
        <li>
            (a+b)<sup>2</sup>= a<sup>2</sup>+2ab+b<sup>2</sup>
        </li>
    </ul>
