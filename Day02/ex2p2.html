        While visiting Dharamshala, it feels like one has visited to a country
        dwelled by Tibetans. But the soul and the soil are truly welcoming.
        Located in Western Himachal region, Dharamshala is a prominent name in
        Buddhist tour to the state, as the home of Dalai Lama and all the
        Tibetans in exile. It is a well-known centre for studying Buddhism, its
        sutras, tantras, and major texts related to this. And now it has emerged
        as one of the major visited sites in Himachal Pradesh attracting
        scholars, pilgrims and tourists alike. In the upper Dharamshala,
        Mcleodganj is the actual residence of His Holiness the Dalai Lama. The
        famous monastery known as Namgyal Gompa has larger than life images of
        the Buddha, Padmasambhava and Avalokiteshwara along with the golden
        prayer wheels. In order to understand the culture of residents at
        Dharamshala, a visit to Tibetan Institute of Performing Arts is a must
        do activity in the region. The hillside town of Dharamsala, stretches
        along the Dhauladhar mountain range in the upper reaches of the scenic
        Kangra district, amidst magnificent deodar, conifer and pine forests,
        tea gardens and mist-soaked hills. Since 1960, when it became the
        temporary headquarters of the Dalai Lama, it has been attracting seekers
        of spiritual enlightenment from all over the world. Dharamsala is
        divided into two distinct parts - Lower Dharamsala, and Upper Dharamsala
        with places like McLeod Ganj and Forsyth Ganj, which bear witness to the
        history of this area. The place is an excellent base for scenic walks
        and treks into the Dhauladhar range. A cricket stadium of international
        reputation serves as the home ground to the Himachal Pradesh state
        cricket team and for other international cricket matches, like the IPL.
        Because of its natural backdrop, it is one of the most quaint and
        attractive cricket stadiums in the world. Best time to visit is from
        March till October.
