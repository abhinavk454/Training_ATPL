        Delhi officially the National Capital Territory (NCT) of Delhi, is a
        city and a union territory of India containing New Delhi, the capital of
        India. Straddling the Yamuna river, primarily its western or right bank,
        Delhi shares borders with the state of Uttar Pradesh in the east and
        with the state of Haryana in the remaining directions. The NCT covers an
        area of 1,484 square kilometres (573 sq mi). According to the 2011
        census, Delhi's city proper population was over 11 million, while the
        NCT's population was about 16.8 million. Delhi's urban agglomeration,
        which includes the satellite cities of Ghaziabad, Faridabad, Gurgaon and
        Noida in an area known as the National Capital Region (NCR), has an
        estimated population of over 28 million, making it the largest
        metropolitan area in India and the second-largest in the world (after
        Tokyo).
