        Mysore, previously known as Mysuru, is the third largest and second most
        populated city of Karnataka. Situated right at the foot of Chamundi
        Hills, Mysore was once the capital of the Kingdom of Mysore. The rich
        cultural environment of Mysore has earned it the moniker of Cultural
        Capital of Karnataka. Mysore Dasara is celebrated with great pomp and
        grandeur for ten days and people from every corner of the globe visit
        this city during the festival. There are some notable heritage
        structures in Mysore like the famous Mysore Palace and the Jaganmohana
        Palace. Other significant tourist spots in Mysore include Somanthapura,
        Karanji Lake & Park, Chamundi Hill, Brindavan Garden and Rail Museum.
