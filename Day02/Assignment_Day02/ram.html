      <p>
        RAM (Random Access Memory) is the hardware in a computing device where
        the operating system (OS), application programs and data in current use
        are kept so they can be quickly reached by the device's processor. RAM
        is the main memory in a computer. It is much faster to read from and
        write to than other kinds of storage, such as a hard disk drive (HDD),
        solid-state drive (SSD) or optical drive. Random Access Memory is
        volatile. That means data is retained in RAM as long as the computer is
        on, but it is lost when the computer is turned off. When the computer is
        rebooted, the OS and other files are reloaded into RAM, usually from an
        HDD or SSD.

      <h1>ROM</h1>

      <p>
        Read-only memory (ROM) is a type of non-volatile memory used in
        computers and other electronic devices. Data stored in ROM cannot be
        electronically modified after the manufacture of the memory device.
        Read-only memory is useful for storing software that is rarely changed
        during the life of the system, also known as firmware. Software
        applications (like video games) for programmable devices can be
        distributed as plug-in cartridges containing ROM.
