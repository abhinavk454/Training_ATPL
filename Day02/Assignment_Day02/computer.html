        A computer is a digital electronic machine that can be programmed to
        carry out sequences of arithmetic or logical operations (computation)
        automatically. Modern computers can perform generic sets of operations
        known as programs. These programs enable computers to perform a wide
        range of tasks. A computer system is a "complete" computer that includes
        the hardware, operating system (main software), and peripheral equipment
        needed and used for "full" operation. This term may also refer to a
        group of computers that are linked and function together, such as a
        computer network or computer cluster. A broad range of industrial and
        consumer products use computers as control systems. Simple
        special-purpose devices like microwave ovens and remote controls are
        included, as are factory devices like industrial robots and
        computer-aided design, as well as general-purpose devices like personal
        computers and mobile devices like smartphones. Computers power the
        Internet, which links billions of other computers and users.
