        Kolkata, Bengali Kalikata, formerly Calcutta, city, capital of West
        Bengal state, and former capital (1772–1911) of British India. It is one
        of India’s largest cities and one of its major ports. The city is
        centred on the east bank of the Hugli (Hooghly) River, once the main
        channel of the Ganges (Ganga) River, about 96 miles (154 km) upstream
        from the head of the Bay of Bengal; there the port city developed as a
        point of transshipment from water to land and from river to sea. A city
        of commerce, transport, and manufacture, Kolkata is the dominant urban
        centre of eastern India
