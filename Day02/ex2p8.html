        Puri is a beautiful city situated in the state of Odisha in Eastern
        India, just 60 KMS away from the capital. It is located along the bay of
        Bengal and offers a beautiful sunlit landscape with palm leaves and the
        glimmering waves on the shoreline. The city flourishes with diverse
        tourists including the holy worshippers in the temples and sun basking
        tourists on the beach making it one of the most admired places to visit
        in not only India but all across the world. It is one of the Char Dham
        i.e. the four most pious pilgrimage sites for Hindus and acquires a huge
        crowd during the magnificent Rath Yatra every year. It has world famous
        temples such as the Jagannath Temple, Gundicha temple, Vimala Temple,
        Loknath Temple and many more. It also has the panch tirtha, a bath into
        which one completes the pilgrimage to Puri. Along with beautiful places
        to visit, the city offers great work of artisans to admire and buy from
        the local shops.
