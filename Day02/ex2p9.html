        Rishikesh is a tehsil located in Uttarakhandâ€™s Tehri Garhwal region
        right on the banks of the holiest of Indian rivers, the Ganges. This
        ancient city has several mythological and religious legends associated
        with Lord Vishnu, Lord Bharat, and various prominent sages and is said
        to have been established in the 9th-century AD by Adi Shankaracharya.
        The scenic beauty of Rishikesh is due to its location at the foothills
        of the lofty Garhwal Himalayas is accentuated by the mighty Ganges
        cutting right through the city. The picturesque city looks suspended
        between the stunning riverside promenades, acres of forests, lush
        mountains, and clear blue skies lending it a surreal appearance.
