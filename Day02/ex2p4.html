        Haridwar, the gateway to the Gods, is situated on the right bank of the
        holy Ganga and is regarded among the seven sacred cities of India.
        Haridwar is also, the gateway to the four major pilgrimages- the Char
        Dham - Kedarnath, Badrinath, Gangotri and Yamunotri. According to Hindu
        mythology, Haridwar is one of the four places where the drops of Amrita,
        the elixir of immortality, accidentally spilled over from the pitcher or
        Kumbha, in which it was being carried away by Garuda, the celestial bird
        and the vehicle of Lord Vishnu. It is, therefore, one of the four venues
        where the Kumbh Mela ' said to the largest congregation of humanity
        anywhere in the world ' is held once every 12 years. Haridwar is also
        the place where the river Ganga enters the Indo-Gangetic plains for the
        first time. Haridwar is also home to several ashrams which specialize in
        teaching meditation and yoga.
