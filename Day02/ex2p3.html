        Srinagar, the summer capital of Jammu and Kashmir is located in the
        heart of the Kashmir valley at an altitude of 1,730 m above sea level.
        Spread on both sides of the river Jhelum the city is famous for its
        natural beauty, gardens, waterfronts and houseboats. Srinagar is called
        the city of lakes and the Venice of the East, fascinating tourists from
        centuries with its beautiful picturesque Himalayan backdrop, glittering
        lakes that are surrounded by houseboats and Shikaras and the majesty of
        Mughal architecture. The very absence of order in the location of the
        houses and their tumbled down appearance add a peculiar charm to the
        scenery. It has its own quaint lifestyle, telling a panoramic fairytale
        tour through the snow-capped mountains and Chinar trees, while enjoying
        the adventurous pleasures of hiking, mountain biking, and rafting. The
        city is also famous for traditional Kashmiri handicrafts and dried
        fruits.
