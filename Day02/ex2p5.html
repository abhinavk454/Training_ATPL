        Founded in AD 1727 by Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh II, Jaipur, the capital
        of Rajasthan is popularly known as the Pink City. With broad avenues and
        spacious gardens, the city is steeped in history and culture. Here the
        past comes alive in magnificent forts and palaces, blushed pink, where
        once lived the maharajas. The bustling bazaars of Jaipur, famous for
        Rajasthan jewellery, fabric and shoes, possess a timeless quality and
        are a treasure-trove for the shoppers. Planned by Vidyadhar
        Bhattacharya, Jaipur holds the distinction of being the first planned
        city of India. Renowned globally for its coloured gems, the capital city
        of Rajasthan combines the allure of its ancient history with all the
        advantages of a metropolis. Jaipur rises up majestically against the
        backdrop of the forts Nahargarh, Jaigarh and Garh Ganesh Temple. The
        bustling modern city is one of the three corners of the golden triangle
        that includes Delhi, Agra and Jaipur. The story goes that in 1876, the
        Prince of Wales visited India on a tour. Since the colour pink was
        symbolic of hospitality, Maharaja Ram Singh of Jaipur painted the entire
        city pink. The pink that colours the city makes for a marvellous
        spectacle to behold.
